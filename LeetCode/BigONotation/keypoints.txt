BigO: O(f(n))
It allows us to talk in a very formal way about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow. 
the relationship between the input size and then the time relative to that input.

Auxiliary space complexity

The binary logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by two before you get a value that's less than or equal to one.
一个数的二进制对数大致测量了你可以将该数除以二多少次，直到得到一个小于或等于一的值。
